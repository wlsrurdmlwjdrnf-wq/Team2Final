### **Technical Guide**

#### **Getting Started**

1. **Import the Package into Unity:**
   - In Unity, go to `Assets` → `Import Package` → `Custom Package...`.
   - Select the `.unitypackage` file and click `Import`.
   - You will find the textures in `Assets/[PackageName]/Textures`.

2. **Create a New Canvas:**
   - Right-click in the **Hierarchy** window → `UI` → `Canvas`.
   - Rename the Canvas for easier management (e.g., “Background Canvas”).
   - Adjust the **Canvas** settings as needed (e.g., set `Render Mode` to `Screen Space - Camera` for games).

3. **Create a 2D Sprite for Background:**
   - Right-click in the **Hierarchy** window → `2D Object` → `Sprite`.
   - Select the sprite and, in the **Inspector** window, assign one of the textures by dragging it into the `Sprite Renderer`'s `Sprite` field.

4. **Adjust Sprite Settings:**
   - Use the **Rect Transform** tool to adjust the size and position of the sprite to fit the background.
   - In the `Sprite Renderer` settings, ensure that the **Draw Mode** is set to `Tiled` for repeating patterns.

#### **Swapping Between Textures**

1. To swap the background texture, select the sprite in the **Hierarchy**.
2. In the **Inspector**, drag and drop a new texture into the `Sprite Renderer`'s `Sprite` field.
3. Your background will automatically update to the new texture. You can swap textures at any time to match different levels or environments in your game.
